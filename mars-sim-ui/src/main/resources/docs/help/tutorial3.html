<hr>
<P>At the top of the Main Simulation Window, just below the window title, is the menu bar,  with headings such as 
'<STRONG>File</STRONG>', '<STRONG>Tools</STRONG>', '<STRONG>Settings</STRONG>', and '<STRONG>Help</STRONG>'.</P>

<P>The <STRONG>File</STRONG> menu deals with the functions you are used to in most menu-driven programs: 
start a New simulation, Save (the default filename is 'default.sim') or Save As (the filename of your choice), and Exit the Simulation</P>

<P>The <STRONG>Tools</STRONG> menu shows a list of 8 Tool Windows available for use in mars-sim.</P> 
<P>Each Tool Window let you observe and interact the settlement in a particular manner. 
You can use an associated function key (F1 to F8) to activate each of these Tool Windows.</P>

<P>The <STRONG>Settings</STRONG> menu lets you choose between full-screen or window mode, skin theme and the volume of background music 
or sound effects.</P>

<P>The <STRONG>Help</STRONG> menu contains the Tutorial as well as the User Guide. 
<P>You can browse the User Guide after you have 
finished this tutorial to get more in-depth information on how mars-sim works.</P>

<P>Directly below the menu bar is the Desktop, where various Tool Windows are resided.</P>

<P>The <STRONG>Status Bar</STRONG> contains three items: a button for accessing the MarsNet, a memory usage label showing 
mars-sim's memory usage on your computer, and the current Earth date/time label of the running simulation.</P>
