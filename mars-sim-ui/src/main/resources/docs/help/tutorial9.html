<H2>Tutorial - Step 9 : Settlement Map Tool</H2>
<hr>
<P>The <A HREF="settlementtool.html">Settlement Map Tool</A> is where you zoom in on a particular settlement - 
as if you were hovering over it and seeing through the buildings with x-ray vision. </P>

<P>You can select which settlement you want to view from the drop-down list. </P>

<P>The map can be zoomed in and out with the zoom slider, and rotated right or left with the rotate buttons. </P>

<P>The settlement map can moved around by mouse dragging. </P>

<P>The Recenter button will reset the map at the settlement's center, default zoom, and rotation. </P>

<P>The Open Info button opens up the settlement info window for the currently selected settlement.</P>

<P>The Labels button will show a drop down when pressed that allows the user to select which types of labels 
to display. </P>

<P>The types of labels include daylight tracking, buildings, construction sites, vehicles, people and bots.</P>

<P>Clicking on a person or a bot will display their Info Window and name in white, along with their current activity.</P>
