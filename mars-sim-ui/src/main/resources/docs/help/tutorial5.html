<H2>Tutorial - Step 5 : Search Tool</H2>
<hr>
<P>The Search Tool is how you may quickly find a particular person, vehicle, or settlement. 
It can get very handy when you want to check up on the latest status of a unit (person, settlement or vehicle).</P>

<P>First, in the 'Search For' box, choose the unit type (person, settlement or vehicle) from the list by hovering over it and click on it.</P> 

<P>Next, you can either type the name in the textfield right below the box, 
or use your mouse to move the scroll bar on the right to highlight the unit of your interest. </P>

<P>If you have already checked 'Open Detail Window' as you double-click on that unit or click on the 'Search' button, 
it will open that its Unit Window and centers your map on the unit. </P>

<P>If you have already checked 'Recenter Mars Navigator' as you double-click on that unit or click on the 'Search' button, 
it will open up the Mars Navigator as well as centering your map on that unit. </P>

<P>Note: if you have the Mars Navigator tool remained open as you choose another unit, the detailed map will be updated to  
CENTER AT the location of the newly opened unit. The location of an unit could be a settlement label or a vehicle label on the detailed map.
