<P>The <A HREF="searchtool.html">Search Tool</a> is how you may quickly find a particular person, vehicle, or settlement. 
It can get very handy when you want to check up on the latest status of a unit (person, settlement or vehicle).</P>

<P>You must select a category of units (person, settlement or vehicle) and then select from the list 
of available units. </P>

<P>A unit's name can be typed in the field above the list and the closest pick from 
that category will be selected on the list.</P>
