<H2>Tutorial - Step 4 : Mars Navigator Tool</H2>
<hr>

<P>The <A HREF="navigator.html">Mars Navigator</a> is basically a constantly updating overview map of Mars 
and your activities on the surface. </P> 

<P>Simply use your mouse to drag around the area inside the detailed map. </P>  

<P>You may also drag the Mars Globe around in order to zoom in a different zoomed-in area.</P> 

<P>In the detailed map, you may see various names of settlements, landmarks, vehicles and vehicles. </P>

<P>There are a total of 8 data layers that you may toggle on/off on the detailed map. </P>

<P><i>Note : since the day/night tracking layer consumes a lot of processing power to obtain the correct data points for simulating the day/night coverage of Mars, 
users may consider unchecking it in order to lower the cpu usage. </i></P>

<P>Currently, there are 10 available minerals that settlers may be able to prospect and mine. </P>

<P>You may toggle on/off the appearance of each mineral on the detailed map. </P>

<P>To see the info of a base or a vehicle, click on its overlaying label on the detailed map and its Unit Window will be opened.</P>
