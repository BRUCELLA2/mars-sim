<H2>Tutorial - Step 11 : Resupply Tool</H2>
<hr>
<P>In a large settlement, some parts may be manufactured to replace the broken ones using certain 3-D printing technology. </P>

<P>However, a majority of items (and buildings) can only be replenished by a re-supply mission from Earth. </P>

<P>In the Resupply Tool, you can create new resupply missions and edit the existing ones. 

<P>There are five categories of Supply Items : Building, Equipment, Part, Resource, and Vehicle </P>

<P>On each resupply mission, you may decide the Destination, the Arrival Date or the # of Sols Until Arrival, the # of immigrants, and the quantity / amount (kg) of the Supply Items. </P>
