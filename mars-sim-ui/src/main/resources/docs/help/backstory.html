<H2>Backstory</H2>
<P>It is Year 2043. Humanity has undertaken a massive international effort to explore Mars. 
Numerous colonies are sprouting up, forming new human societies in this new world, on this new continent.</P>

<P>As a social simulation, mars-sim models in terms of a settler's career type, job role, technical skills, personality and 
temperament and relationship with one another as they go about their day-to-day lives tending greenhouses, producing food products, 
prospecting minerals, manufacturing equipment and parts, doing scientific inquiry...</P>

<P>There are many different settlements spread out across the planet, ranging from simple 4-person initial landing habitats, 
to a mining town and more mature bases hosting dozens of people and advanced buildings. </P>

<P>Mars is a hostile environment. It is harsh and dangerous. Fortunately, you have skilled professionals at your disposal.</P>

<P>The settlers spend time maintaining their settlements, growing crops in their greenhouses, and manufacturing 
needed parts and equipment from collected local resources. </P>

<P>Meanwhile, some prefer to venture out on rover missions to study the surrounding area, explore uncharted territories, 
prospect and mine mineral concentrations, and trade with their neighboring settlements.</P>

<P> Settlers come face-to-face with accidents, equipment malfunctions, illnesses, injuries, and even death. 
Survival depends on how well they work together, improve their survival skills and balance individual vs. settlement needs.</P>


<P>mars-sim is not a classic game with a linear storyline or a set of rigidly defined goals.
It is a social 'what-if' multi-agent modeling and simulation experiment. There are no badges of achievement medals. 
As your settlers build up resources and survive hardship, you are rewarded with the pure joy of seeing the progress of humanity in 
charting out and colonizing Mars.</P>
