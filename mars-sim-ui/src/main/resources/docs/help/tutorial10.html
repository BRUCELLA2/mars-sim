<hr>
<P>The <A HREF="sciencetool.html">Science Tool</A> is where you oversee the various research projects that your scientists are conducting. </P>

<P>It shows a list of on-going and finished Scientific Studies (its subject, level and phase). </P>

<P>If you click on a particular study, it will display the detail on the right panel showing 
also the primary researcher and collaborators and its percentage of completion in the progress bar.</P>

<P>Currently, all scientific studies are generated automatically by mars-sim. </P>

<P><i>Note: in future, users may create a plan of study for the researchers and upon completion, some may have immediate application in the health of the settlement and the impact to its inhabitants.</i> </P>
