<H2>Tutorial - Step 2 : The Main Simulation Window</H2>
<hr>
<P>The Main Simulation Window is the large window which forms the base of the simulation. </P>
<P>It houses the Menu Bar on the top, the Desktop (one with a brownish background texture) in the middle and the Status Bar at the bottom. </P>
<P>The Desktop is where all the Tool Windows and Unit Windows are displayed.</P>
<P>Upon start of a new simulation, you will see that the Tutorial has already been opened.</P> 
<P>Next, we'll go over each option on the Menu Bar.</P>
