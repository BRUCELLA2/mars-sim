<hr>
<P>The <A HREF="missiontool.html">Mission Tool</A> is where you see all the ongoing missions the settlers 
are currently having.</P> 

<P>In mars-sim, a mission may be generated and completed based upon the need of the settlement 
without user's intervention.</P>

<P>However, user may manually create new missions and/or modify and/or delete existing ones</P>  

<P>The 'Info' tab shows the relevant info of a mission.</P>

<P>The 'Navpoints' tab displays a small map showing various rally points or locations where 
the mission will take place.</P>
