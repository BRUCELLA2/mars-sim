<H2>Help Browser</H2>
<P>The Help Browser is a tool that provides buttons to quickly take you to the inline tutorial, the user guide, the about page as well as the online resources. </P>
<hr>
<P>The address bar shows you the local path of the html page you are reading or the hyperlink of the website you're visiting. </P>
<P>The '<' button (or backspace) returns you to the page you previously visited. </P>
<P>The 'Go' button reloads the link on the address bar. </P>
<P>The '>' button sends you back to the next page that you have visited before you hit the '<'. </P>
<P>Note: normally, the page you are currently on is saved as the 'next' page for you to returns to whenever you hit '<'. </P>
<H4>Link Preview</H4>
<P>If your mouse cursor hovers over a hyperlink, it will attempt to print out its local path or http link on the status bar. </P>
