<H2>Configuration Editor and Crew Editor</H2>
<P>The Configuration Editor allows you to configure what type of initial settlements you would like to start with in a new simulation you are going to create.</P>
<P>It displays a table of settlements soon to be created in the new simulation.  The table is initially populated with a default set of settlements.</P>
<P>The settlement table shows the settlement's name, template, population, # of bots, sponsoring agency, latitude and longitude.  
Each of these fields can edited by clicking or double clicking on them. </P>

<P>If a field is changed to an invalid value, a red error message appears below the table and 
the Start button will be disabled until it is fixed.</P>

<P>The Add button will add a new settlement with a random configuration to the table.</P>
<P>The Remove button will remove any selected settlements from the table.</P>
<P>The Undo will clear all user changes and reset the table to holding only the two default settlements.</P>
<P>The Start button will close the dialog, create and start a new simulation with the configured settlements.</P>
<P>The Crew Editor button allows you to edit the alpha crew roster.</P>

<H2>Crew Editor</H2>
<P>The Alpha Crew Editor presents the user a degree of freedom in customizing up to 4 settlers. Their characteristics 
are pre-configured in people.xml. You may change their individual names, genders, jobs, personality types and the common
 destination to your liking.</P>
