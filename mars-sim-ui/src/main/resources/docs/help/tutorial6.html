<H2>Tutorial - Step 6 : Time Tool</H2>
<hr>
<P>The Time Tool keeps track of how date and time go by on Mars and Earth in mars-sim. </P>
<P>1. Martian Time : the current Martian time in the format of YY-MMM-DD mmm.mmm. </P>
<P><i>Note : YY are the martian year. MMM are the month, DD are the day. mmm.mmm are the millisols (0 to 1000) 
of a sol that is up to the 3 decimal places </i></P>
<P>2. Martian Calendar : displays a Martian Calendar with the sol of the week/month highlighted. </P>
<P>3. Martian Seasons : shows the current season one would experience on the Northern and southern hemisphere of Mars. </P>
<P>4. Earth Time : shows the corresponding date and time on Earth. </P>
<P>5. Simulation Uptime : displays how long mars-sim has been running. </P>
<P>6. Tick Per Second (TPS) : shows how fast mars-sim updates the changes. </P>
<P><i>Note : TPS is essentially the same as a more common programming construct called "Frames Per Second" (FPS) in designing the game loop for mars-sim. </P>
<P>e.g. if TPS/FPS is 25, then for each second, the simulation is updated 25 times. </i></P>
<P>7. Pause Button : click to toggle between pause and resume the simulation or hit the 'ESC' button once on your keyboard anytime. </P> 
<P>8. Real to Sim Time Ratio : shows the ratio of the real time to the simulation time. </P>
<P>By default, it is set to the ratio of 1 second of real time to 8 minutes and 20 seconds of simulation time. </P>
<P>You may speed up (or slow down) the simulation by dragging the handle to the right (or to the left). </P>
