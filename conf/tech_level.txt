Tech Levels
-----------

Tech levels are used to measure the capability of laboratories, 
medical facilities and manufacturing workshops in the configuration files.

Research Laboratories
---------------------

tech level 1: Field laboratory capable of basic research but 
              doesn't have advanced instruments.

tech level 2: Clinical laboratory with advanced instruments.

tech level 3: Advanced laboratory with state of the art equipment.


Medical Facilities
------------------

tech level 1: Medical pack for field dressing wounds and applying 
              antibiotics.

tech level 2: Simple medical station with capacity for the treatment
              of broken limbs with plaster casts.
              
tech level 3: Basic medical facility with a operating table.  Minor
              operations can be performed here as well as extended
              treatment of illnesses.
              
tech level 4: Medical facility with capacity for advanced surgery.
              Major operations can be performed here.
              
tech level 5: Medical facility capable of advanced treatment, such
              as treating severe burn patients with skin grafts.
              
              
Manufacturing Workshops
-----------------------

tech level 1: Basic processing of regolith and ores to produce metals
              and other resources.
              
tech level 2: Advanced metal working and simple glass production.

tech level 3: Advanced glass production including fiberglass.  Basic
              plastics production.
              
tech level 4: Advanced plastics production.  Fiberglass cloth weaving
              and reinforced fiberglass.
