Time
----

Martian time is represented in the simulation by Shaun Moss's "Areosynchronous Calendar".

The Areosynchronous Calendar is a derivative of Tom Gangale's Darian Calendar.

The week and month names are based on Frans Blok's "The Rotterdam System".

The time of the day is based on Bruce Mackenzie's "Metric Time for Mars".
