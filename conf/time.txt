Time
----

The Martian calendar used in this simulation is based on Shaun Moss's "Areosynchronous Calendar".
http://pweb.jps.net/~gangale3/moss/Virtual_Mars/Calendar.asp

The Areosynchronous Calendar is heavily derived from Tom Gangale's Darian Calendar.
http://pweb.jps.net/~tgangale/mars/mst/darian.htm

The Martian year is referred to as an "orbit".  It is 668.5921 Martian days ("Sols") long.  In the
calendar, about half of the orbits are 668 Sols long, and the other half are "leap-orbits" with 669 
Sols.  See the Areosynchronous Calendar for complete details on leap-orbits.

The orbit has 24 months with either 27 or 28 Sols:

The month names are based on Frans Blok's "The Rotterdam System".
http://www.geocities.com/fra_nl/rotmonth.html

There are seven sols in a Martian week with the following week names:

Heliosol
Neriosol
Libersol
Terrasol
Venusol
Mercusol
Jovisol

Every Martian month has 4 weeks.  On months with 27 Sols, the last week only has
six Sols and Jovisol is clipped.  This allows the first Sol of every month and 
every orbit to be Heliosol.

The calendar uses metric time for Mars with the Sol broken up into the following common units:

decasol  = 1/10 Sol   = 2.46 Earth hours
centisol = 1/100 Sol  = 14.8 Earth minutes
millisol = 1/1000 Sol = 1.48 Earth minutes

Martian time of the Sol is usually written in three-digit millisol format to three decimal points.
ex. from "000.000" to "999.999".

The common timstamp format for Mars date/time is orbit-month-sol:millisols.  ex. "17-Adir-03:523.234"

The time of the day is based on Bruce Mackenzie's "Metric Time for Mars".
