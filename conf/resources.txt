Resources
---------

Resources are materials that are used and stored in the simulation.  
Resources are measured in kg.

Here are the resources used in version 2.75:

Water
Hydrogen
Oxygen
Methane
Carbon Dioxide
Carbon Monoxide
Food
Rock Samples
Waste Water
Ice

The food resource represents dried or frozen food that will not spoil with time.  
Food is harvested from crops in a greenhouse.

The rock samples resource are rock specimens collected for areological research.

The waste water resource is sewage water that can be used as fertilizer for crops.
The crops help filter the waste water back to potable/drinking water.

The ice resource is actually an ice/soil mixture collected from Martian permafrost
in the ice prospecting mission.  It can be melted and filtered to produce 
potable/drinking water.

The resource names in the configuration files are not case-sensitive.
