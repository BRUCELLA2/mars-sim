		Corn stover is a broad term which describes all of the above ground biomass
		from the corn crop except the grain. This biomass is comprised of structural
		components including stalks, leaves, tassel, husk, and cob. The U.S. Department of
		Energy estimates that over 76 million metric tons of corn stover are available from the
		roughly 28 million hectares of corn produced each year (Perlack, 2005).  

		Worldwide, with a yield of over 5 T/ha . Production can be significantly higher in certain regions of the world;
		2009 forecasts for production in Iowa were 11614 kg/ha

		Use (11.6 + 5)/2 = 8.30 T/ha
		8.30*100/65 = 12.77 g/m2/d

		Field corn vs. Sweet corn
		Although field corn is used mostly to create other products, sweet corn can be used as well.
		Plastics are manufactured from 		both types of corn to replace petroleum-based products.
		These include batteries, packaging materials, plastic silverware and other plastic products
		(such as skin and hair care bottles), toothpaste, candles, shampoo and dozens of others.
		A corn-based fuel for transportation, ethanol, is added to gasoline and is sold at many gas stations.

	<!--    Taro can be grown for its tubers only where summers are long–at least 200 frost-free, warm days.
			http://www.harvesttotable.com/2010/03/taro/
			Taro is a perennial herbaceous plant that grows from 3 to 6 feet tall. Its leaves are light green,
			elongated, and heart shaped similar to an elephant’s ear. Tubers are spherical and about the size
			of a tennis ball often covered with brownish skin and hairs; the flesh is pinkish purple, beige or white.
			Taro requires seven months of hot weather to mature.

	inedible-biomass :  [ gram / m^2 / day ]

	Note: 1 metric ton = 1 tonnes

	1 tonnes per hectare = 0.1 kg per m^2
	Thus, 1/100 tonnes per hectare per day = 1 gram per m^2 per day

8.  Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is light with a wavelength between 300/400 nm and 700 nm

	Researchers measure instantaneous light in micro-moles (μmol) per square
	meter (m-2) per second (s-1), or: μmol·m-2·s-1 of PAR.

	This “quantum” unit quantifies the number of photons (individual particles of energy)
	used in photosynthesis that fall on a square meter (10.8 square feet) every second.

	This light measurement is an instantaneous reading.

	Daily light integral (DLI) or Daily PAR is the amount of PAR received
	each day as a function of light intensity (instantaneous light: μmol·m-2·s-1) and duration (day).
	It is expressed	as moles of light (mol) per square meter (m-2) per day (d-1), or: mol·m-2·d-1 (moles per day).
	The DLI concept is like a rain gauge.

	Just as a rain gauge collects the total rain in a particular location over
	a period of time, so DLI measures the total amount of PAR received in a day.

	Greenhouse growers can use	light meters to measure the number of light photons that accumulate in a square meter over a 24-hour period.

11. MPR Model: a crop model that consists of a set of nonlinear polynomial equations, six for each crop,
	developed using multivariate polynomial regression (MPR).

	The dependent variables for three of the six MPR equations are the relative growth rates
	of (a) total dry mass prior to formation of yield bearing organs, (b) total dry mass after the
	formation of yield bearing organs, and (c) yield dry mass.

	The independent variables used in each equation include the average PPF, T, and CO2 values (averaged from planting date up to
	the current time increment t), and the total or yield dry mass at t-1.

	The model-based predictive controller adjusts light intensity, atmospheric/elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration,
	(photosynthetic photon flux (PPF), average daily air temperature (T),

12. E.A. Mitsherlich (1909) proposed a theory of “Law of diminishing returns” states that,
	‘The increase in any crop produce by a unit increment of a deficient factor is proportional to the
	decrement of that factor from the maximum and the response is curvilinear instead of linear’.
	Mitscherlich equation is dy/dx = C (A-Y) where,

		d – increment or change
		dy – amount of increase in yield
		dx – amount of increment of the growth factor x.
		A – Maximum possible yield
		Y – Yield obtained for the given quantity of factor ‘x’ and
		C – Proportionality constant that depends on the nature of the growth factor

	In mars-sim,

		Maximum harvest = max harvest mass [kg per day] * crop's growing day,

		Max harvest mass is daily modified by the availability of

		1. fertilizer
		2. water
		3. CO2
		4. O2
		5. sunlight
		6. planting/daily tending work required vs. served


13. Prior to mars-sim version 3.1.0, there are 4 standard phases of a food crop:

	a. Planting
	b. Germination
	c. Growing
	d. Harvesting

	In reality, each crop may have unique growth stages or phenology.

15. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nation (http://www.fao.org/docrep/X5642E/x5642e06.htm),
	there is 9 types of vegetable crops based on edible part:

	a. Root vegetables (carrots, beetroot, radish)
	b. Tuber vegetables (Yam, Irish potato)
	c. Corm (Taro)
	d. Stem vegetable (Asparagus)
	e  Leaf vegetables (Lettuce, Amaranth)
	f  Bulb vegetable (Onion, garlic)
	g. Fruit vegetable (Tomato, okra)
	h. Flower vegetables (Broccoli, Cauliflower)
	i. Seed vegetable (Berus, Peas)

	for root/tuber/corm, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_root_vegetables

	In mars-sim, we have 14 categories:

	roots
	tubers
	corms
	stems
	leaves
	bulbs
	fruits
	flowers
	seeds
	legumes (peanut, peas, soybean, kidney bean)
	grains ( rice, quinoa, wheat)
	grasses
	fungi
	spices / herbs

	http://www.passthepistil.com/transplanting-seedlings-vs-direct-sowing-seeds/

18. Annuals - Plants that perform their entire life cycle from seed to flower
	to seed within a single growing season. All roots, stems and leaves of the plant die annually.
	Only the dormant seed bridges the gap between one generation and the next.

19. Perennials - Plants that persist for many growing seasons. Generally the top portion of
	the plant dies back each winter and regrows the following spring from the same root system
	(e.g. Purple Coneflower). Many perennial plants do keep their leaves year round and offer
	attractive borders and groundcover (e.g. Tickseed, Shasta and Ox-Eyed Daisy).

	NOTE: WHEN STARTING PERENNIAL PLANTS FROM SEED, BLOOMS WILL BE OBSERVED IN EITHER THE SPRING
	OR SUMMER OF THE SECOND YEAR AND EACH YEAR THEREAFTER (e.g. Ox-Eyed Daisy planted in the
	spring of 1996 will not bloom until the spring of 1997).

20. Biennials - Plants which require two years to complete their life cycle. First season growth
	results in a small rosette of leaves near the soil surface. During the second season's
	growth stem elongation, flowering and seed formation occur followed by the entire plant's death.

	Carrots, parsley, and onions are biennial crops.

21. Annual/Perennial - A plant can behave as an annual or a perennial depending on local climatic
	and geographic growing conditions. In the southern portion of the United States, these plants
	tend to grow much quicker than in the north due to the warmer weather and extended growing season.

	For example: a Black-Eyed Susan would behave as an annual if grown in Louisiana; whereas,
	if grown in Ohio, a Black-Eyed Susan would behave as a perennial.

30. http://extension.illinois.edu/bulbs/bulbbasics.cfm

	Corms vs. Bulbs :
	
	Bulbs can be broken down into five types of storage structures. 
	These include: true bulbs, corms, tubers, tuberous roots and rhizomes. 
	A sixth category of fleshy roots has been added here for the purpose of showing the structure. 
	e.g. Daylilies and peonies, are popular bulb plants with gardeners.
	
	A corm is a swollen stem base that is modified into a mass of storage tissue. 
	A corm does not have visible storage rings when cut in half. This distinguishes it from a true bulb.
	The corm contains a basal plate (bottom of bulb from which roots develop),thin tunic and a growing point. 
	e.g. Plants that develop from corms include gladiolus, crocus, and autumn crocus.
