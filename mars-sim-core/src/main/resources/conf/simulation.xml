	<!-- Time related configuration -->
	<time-configuration>

		<!-- time-ratio (TR) is the default simulation time ratio : the ratio of real time to sim time -->
		<!-- It denotes the speed of the simulation -->
		<!-- Value must be positive number between 0.001 and 10800 and cannot be zero -->
		<!-- Default: 512.0 -->
		<time-ratio value="512" />
		<!-- 1. time ratio will be re-scaled according to available # of threads (not # of cpu cores).
			 2. time ratio must be a multiple of 2.
			 3. if time ratio is 512, then 1 real second equals 512 simulation seconds in mars-sim
			 4. Minimum is 64, maximum is 1024
		-->

		<!-- time-between-updates (TBU) is the ideal time interval between two successive updates [in milliseconds] -->
		<!-- It is essentially the maximum sleep time between two game iterations or updates.
			 The smaller the TBU, the better the "resolution" of the simulation -->
		<!-- Frames Per Second (FPS) or Ticks Per Seconds (TPS) [in hertz] is just the reciprocal of TBU  -->
		<!-- Value must be positive number between 40.0 and 250.0 and preferably be a multiple of 2 and cannot be zero -->
		<!-- Default: 40.0 Will automatically set to a multiple of its value if having less threads-->
		<time-between-updates value="40.0" />
		<!-- e.g. 40 ms is equal to 25 Hz ( 1/40ms = 25 Hz ) -->
		<!-- NOTE: the product of time-ratio and time-between-updates is the default time elapsed -->
		<!-- e.g. 40 ms * 25 Hz = 20,000 ms or 20 seconds -->
		<!-- since 1 millisols = 88.78 seconds, 20 seconds is 0.2253 millisols -->
		<!-- For each interval of real time (40 ms), a time period of 0.2253 millisols has just been elapsed in the simulation-->


		<!-- no-delays-per-yield is the maximum number of counts allowed in waiting for other threads to execute -->
		<!-- It avoids the use of an arbitrary sleep period in the MasterClock game loop -->
		<!-- Value must be positive integer between 1 and 200 -->
		<!-- Default: 16 -->
		<no-delays-per-yield value="16" />
		<!-- e.g. If the game update and rendering steps take longer than the iteration period, say, 42 ms,
			 then at the next iteration, it will not resort to sleep for 40 ms as usual. This cause a counter
			 to increment. If the counter exceeds the default value of 16, the game loop will be told to
			 wait and yield for other threads to finish execution before it resumes -->


		<!-- max-frame-skips is the number of skipped frames allowed -->
		<!-- It is a measure of tolerance of the maximum number of lost frame. Sometimes, the simulation take
			too long (say, more than the default 40 ms) to finish its execution in a frame.
			Then by the time the next update is due, the simulation has yet finished the previous frame.
			max_frame-skips should be fine-tuned with the TBU together -->
		<!-- The large the max-frame-skips, the more sudden the game jump forward -->
		<!-- Value must be positive integer between 1 and 200 -->
		<!-- Default: 20 -->
		<max-frame-skips value="20" />
		<!-- e.g. Suppose a simulation takes a prolonged period of 400 ms to complete the execution. In 400 ms, it should
			have call the MasterClock to update the game loop 10 times (if the default TBU is 40 ms).
			If max-frame-skips is set to 10, then it would NOT try to immediately run 10 updates back-to-back
			just to catch up with the lost frames. The normal behavior of the MasterClock is that it will dynamically
			adjust the value of TBU in order to recover as many lost frames as possible by running a update as soon as
			it is due -->


		<!-- Earth start date/time -->
		<!-- "yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss" format -->
		<!-- Default: 2043-09-30 00:00:00 -->
		<!-- Note that changing this date to another value is currently UNSUPPORTED -->
		<earth-start-date-time value="2043-09-30 00:00:00 GMT00:00 " />

		<!-- Mars start date/time -->
		<!-- (See time.txt) -->
		<!-- "orbit-month-sol millisol" format -->
		<!-- Default: 15-Adir-01 000.000 -->
		<!-- Note that changing this date to another value is currently UNSUPPORTED -->
		<mars-start-date-time value="15-Adir-01 000.000" />

		<!-- autosave-interval is the number of minutes the simulation will wait between two successive autosave events -->
		<!-- Value must be a positive number between 1 and 1440 and cannot be zero -->
		<!-- Min : 1 ; Max : 1440 -->
		<!-- Default: 15 -->
		<autosave-interval value="15" />

		<!-- average transit-time is the number of sols to send payload/cargo from Earth to Mars -->
		<!-- Min : 1 ; Max : 430 -->
		<!-- Default: 60 -->
