The Mars Simulation Project can be configured by editing the 
XML files inside mars-sim-core-${Version}.jar's 'conf' subdirectory.
 
It's recommended you use utility tool such as '7 Zip File Manager' 
to manipulate these xml files inside the jar file without having to 
compress and uncompress other files. 

It is recommended that you make a backup of the original configuration
file before editing it as user-created XML errors can cause mars-sim
fail to start.
