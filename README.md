# mars-sim
*The Mars Simulation Project* is a Java-based [open source](https://opensource.dev/) project that simulates the activities of the first generation of settlers on Mars with a higher fidelity of modeling and simulation details than a typical PC strategy game. 

---

## Simulation
mars-sim is a **general purpose** simulator depicting the early development of human settlements on Mars. According to *Encyclop√¶dia Britannica*, a computer simulation is the use of a computer to represent the dynamic responses of one system by the behavior of another system modeled after it. In essence, a simulation is a mathematical description, or model, of a real system in the form of a computer program. 

mars-sim aims to integrate and  incorporate as many research disciplines (such as physics, chemistry, biology, economics, psychology, and social science) as possible to simulate the dynamics and behaviors of people, social structure, physical and mechanical systems, and environment in the context of developing human settlements on Mars. 

A settler will be a computer agent possessing certain prescribed attributes, dynamic properties and the external characteristics imposed on it. Each makes weighted decisions and interact with one another to produce unexpected results in a sandbox world.

For instance, each settler has a well-defined job, a role, a bunch of technical [skills](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Skills), a set of personality, natural [attributes](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Attributes), and task preferences (likes and dislikes). They build [relationship](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Relationship) as they interact and work with one another. They are there to live, dream, explore, and settle Mars. 

---

## Operation Modeling
mars-sim adopts a rich set of scientific vocabulary from research journal and paper when it comes to defining operation paradigms and programming models based on the present day technologies that are applicable for the near-term human exploration and settlement on Mars.

For instance, the simulation assumes a low-pressure living environment that facilitates EVA and reduces structural requirements on buildings. 

While at the Earth's sea level, the atmospheric pressure is **101 kPa** (14.7 psi) and has 20.9% oxygen, in mars-sim, a low pressure atmosphere of **34 kPa** (5 psi) is chosen for the settlement and, as a result, the composition of oxygen inside a settlement is 58.8%. 

Other than oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water moisture indoor are continuously monitored and replenished periodically in each building being equipped with various life-support system [functions](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Building-Function). These gases are generated via systems such as **Sabatier Reverse Water Gas (SRWG)**, and **Oxygen Generation System (OGS)**, etc..

Another example is modeling the sequence of operations involving the airlock for an **Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA)**. In mars-sim, an *airlock* is an immediate place between a settlement and outside. In order to walk on the surface of Mars, a settler must come through an airlock, which is found in a *Lander Hab* or a *Garage*. To perform a team EVA, one of them will be selected as the *airlock operator*. He will ensure that before entering the *inner door* of the airlock from within the settlement, the airlock would have to be *pressurized* first and the air would be heated so that the atmospheric pressure and temperature is equalized. Then he would open the inner door and the whole team will enter the airlock chamber. Once he locks the inner door. he will  *depressurize* the chamber, meaning, the gases would be re-captured to match the air pressure and the gas composition of that of the surface of Mars. Then he will open the *outer door* of the airlock to allow the egress of the team outside.

The third example is the [Radiation Modeling](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Radiation-Exposure), which accounts for how often the **Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR)** and **Solar Energetic Particles (SEP)** would occur during EVA. The cumulative dose is closely monitored in 3 specific periods of time, namely, the 30-day, the annual and the career lifetime of a settler.

## Settlement Development 
Player may create numerous settlements spreading across the surface of Mars. Each settlement has a *command structure* and a *development [objective](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Settlement-Objective)*. They can be as simple as a four-person initial base (loosely following the Mars Direct Mission Plan by Robert Zubrin), a trading outpost, a mining depot near sites with high mineral concentration; or a self-contained colony with 48+ settlers having an elected mayor. 

---

## Economics
In terms of [economic](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Economics) modeling, mars-sim implements a value point (VP) system, which keeps track of the supply and demand on each resource. There is no standard currency established on Mars yet. 
Traders barter trades with neighboring settlements and the surplus/ deficit based on the VPs of the resources in exchange in each trading session.

---

## Jobs and Missions
Settlers spend much of their time learning to *live off the land*. Assigning meaningful [jobs](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Jobs) to the settlers are vital to the health of the economy of the settlements. Settlers engage in various [tasks](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Tasks) such as maintenance, ensuring life support resources are well balanced, growing crops in [greenhouses](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Greenhouse-Operation), making secondary [food products](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Food-Production), and manufacturing needed parts and equipment in workshops.

Settlers will also go out on field [Missions](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Missions) to explore and study the surrounding landscapes, to prospect and mine minerals, and to trade with neighboring settlements, etc. They may even decide to migrate from one settlement to another.

---

## Reliability and Malfunctions
The perils of living on Mars are very real. There are close to 30 types of [Malfunctions](https://github.com/mars-sim/mars-sim/wiki/Field-Reliability-and-Malfunctions) that can strike. The failure rate, the Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) and the reliability of parts are tracked real-time and updated dynamically based on field available data during the simulation.

---

## Summary
Mars is a harsh world but is certainly less unforgiving than our Moon. Settlers come face-to-face with accidents, equipment malfunctions, illnesses, injuries, and even death. Survival depends on how well they work together, improve their survival skills and balance individual versus settlement needs. The reward of

As the settlers learn how to survive the hardship and build up their settlements, players are rewarded with the pure joy of participating in this grand social experiment of creating a new branch of human society on another planetary surface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Require Java 8 (u77 or above) for binaries compiled under Java 8 
* Require Java 9/10 for binaries compiled under Java 9

```
Note 1 : Beginning Java 11, the JRE/JDK has been decoupled from the graphic JavaFX API. If you use OpenJDK 11, make sure you also download OpenJFK 11 **separately**. 
Feel free to discuss how to set up mars-sim to run it under Java 11. See also #156.
```

* For Windows OS, one should manually set up the following : 
  - Edit the `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` in the *Environment Variables* in Control Panel 
  - Set `JAVA_HOME` to a JRE or JDK's destination such as `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-10.0.2` or `C:\Program Files\Java\jre-10.0.2`
  - Add `%JAVA_HOME%;%JAVA_HOME%\bin;` to `PATH`         
  - Remove any path similar to `C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath;`  in `PATH` variable. It can interfere with the correct version of 
    Java that you would like to use. 
  - Check if the correct version of Java is being enabled in the **Java Control Panel** in Windows's Control Panel. 

```
Note 2 : The order of precedence inside `PATH` is crucial. The first available folder having Java executable inside will be the one to be loaded  by Windows OS. 

Note 3 : The BEST approach is to enable only one Java build (such as Java 10.0.2) inside `PATH` and remove all other folders referencing other java versions/builds.

Note 4 : To test the version of Java that your machine is using, type "java -version" in a terminal/command prompt.

Note 5 : Remove all Java related executables inside the folder `C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath` in order to avoid loading the undesired version of jre/jdk.
```
