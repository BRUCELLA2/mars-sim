## v3.1.0 (build 3739) Snapshot Preview 3 - 2016-10-08

### NEW FEATURES :

1. Added user's option to change the height of the MarsNet chat box with the command '/y1', '/y2', '/y3', and '/y4' to suit the resolution of user's monitor.
/y1 --> 256 pixels (by default)
/y2 --> 512 pixels
/y3 --> 768 pixels
/y4 --> 1024 pixels 

2. Added new user's keyword "settlement"/"vehicle"/"rover" in the chat box for reporting # of settlements in total and their names and to query the total # and types of vehicles/rovers (parked and/or on mission). 

### FIXES :

1. Fixed volume control with the ability to mute both the background music and sound effects.

2. Fixed NullPointerException/other bugs when loading a saved sim in either the Main Menu or the command prompt.

3. Added animated loading/saving/paused indicators.



### IMPROVEMENTS:

1. Refactored the meteorite impact calculation in MeteoriteImpactImpl.java and completed Part I and II below. (Part III still in-work). 

Note: any observable impact will increase the stress level of the settlers on that building if his/her natural attribute of courage and emotional stability are not high enough.
 
Part I : Calculate the probability of impact per square meter per sol on the settlement, assuming the meteorite has an average impact velocity of 1km/s, critical diameter of .0016 cm and average density of 1 g/cm^3, per NASA study.

Part II: Calculate how far the incoming meteorite may penetrate the wall of a building

Part III: Implement equations of the probability distribution of different sizes of the meteorites. This no longer assumes the size and impact speed of the meteorites are homogeneous as in Part I and II.

2. Minimized or prevented EVA operations during intense Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) and Solar Energetic Particles (SEP) events for reducing radiation exposure. Refactored probability of exposure to conform better to NASA study.

## v3.1.0 (build 3729) Snapshot Preview 2 - 2016-09-27

### NEW FEATURES :

1. Added codes to abort an on-going vehicle mission without activating the emergency beacon. Vehicle will drive to the settlement if fuel and consumables are still available.

2. Optimizied the stress modifier on a few AI tasks.

3. Added more first and last names (of various national origin) in people.xml for settlers from various sponsoring space agencies.

4. Added new part "heat pipe" and used it throught the sim.


### FIXES :

1. Temporarily disabled the ability for settlers to start a construction mission on his own (bug fixes still in-work).

2. Removed some case of a NullPointerException during a resupply mission and a building construction mission.

3. Fixed inability to save as default.sim and as other file names.

4. Fixed NullPointerException in Career Tab of a deceased person when opening the Person Window. 

5. Fixed NullPointerException in Location Tab of a vehicle in some cases when opening the Vehicle Window.



### IMPROVEMENTS/OTHERS :

1. Added Description, Type and Phase of an on-going mission to the top right of the panel in Mission Tool.

2. Limited the # of Sols activities to be saved to 100 Sols.

3. Improved linux compatibility in displaying UI.

4. Prevented settlers from having duplicated first and last names in a settlement. The chance of this happening in the real world is remotely possible. Therefore, we preclude it from happening in mars-sim.

5. Shrunk the size of the binaries by removing unused contents.

6. Revised files for the debian package, which can be installed via GDebi (Debian Package Installer) in linux.
