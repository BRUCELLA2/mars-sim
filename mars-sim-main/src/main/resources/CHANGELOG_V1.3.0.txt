--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v3.1.0 (build 3729) Snapshot Preview 2


NEW FEATURES :

1. Added codes to abort an on-going vehicle mission without activating the emergency beacon. Vehicle will drive to the settlement if fuel and consumables are still available.

2. Optimizied the stress modifier on a few AI tasks.

3. Added more first and last names (of various national origin) in people.xml for settlers from various sponsoring space agencies.

4. Added new part "heat pipe" and used it throught the sim.



FIXES :

1. Temporarily disabled the ability for settlers to start a construction mission on his own (bug fixes still in-work).

2. Removed some case of a NullPointerException during a resupply mission and a building construction mission.

3. Fixed inability to save as default.sim and as other file names.

4. Fixed NullPointerException in Career Tab of a deceased person when opening the Person Window. 

5. Fixed NullPointerException in Location Tab of a vehicle in some cases when opening the Vehicle Window.



IMPROVEMENTS/OTHERS :

1. Added Description, Type and Phase of an on-going mission to the top right of the panel in Mission Tool.

2. Limited the # of Sols activities to be saved to 100 Sols.

3. Improved linux compatibility in displaying UI.

4. Prevented settlers from having duplicated first and last names in a settlement. The chance of this happening in the real world is remotely possible. Therefore, we preclude it from happening in mars-sim.

5. Shrunk the size of the binaries by removing unused contents.

6. Revised files for the debian package, which can be installed via GDebi (Debian Package Installer) in linux.
