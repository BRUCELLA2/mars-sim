------------------------------------------------------

## v3.1.0 (build 38__) Snapshot Preview 6 - 2017-02-__

### KNOWN LIMITATIONS :

1. The Tabs cannot be clicked in MacOSX due to unknown bugs in JavaFX's TabPane. One can still have access to all the Tools in MacOS's top menu.

2. Main Menu's 3D Mars Globe may display shadow artifact when running in linux. May crash when attempting to change a text field.

3. User must have 64-bit 1.8.0.91 or higher version of Java 8 SE or JDK installed on the machine. It's not compatible with 32-bit Java 8 or any versions of OpenJDK.


### CORE ENGINE IMPROVEMENTS :

1. Add lists of first and last names for each of the 22 countries of ESA.

2. Add combo boxes for choosing country and sponsorship for each member of the Alpha Crew in Crew Editor.

### UI IMPROVEMENT :

1. Add sound control panel, calendar panel and speed panel.

2. Consolidate various tools into the Main tabs. Reduce the # of available tabs to 3.

### FIXES :

1. Fix a bug preventing a new settlement from showing up in the Settlement combo box in Settlement Map.

------------------------------------------------------

## v3.1.0 (build 3837) Snapshot Preview 5 - 2017-01-10


### KNOWN LIMITATIONS :

1. The Graphic Mode cannot run under MacOSX due to some unknown bugs when loading jfoenix's JFXTabPane. However, it can still run under Headless Mode in MacOSX.

2. Main Menu's 3D Mars Globe may display shadow artifact when running in linux (due to unknown recent JavaFX changes)

3. User must have 64-bit Java 8 SE or JDK (at least 1.8.0.60 version) installed. Currently, it's not compatible with 32-bit Java 8 or any versions of OpenJDK.



### CORE ENGINE IMPROVEMENTS :

1. Scale cpu utilization according to the available number of threads in the CPU.

- Slower CPUs will have lower pulse per seconds and time ratio.


### UI IMPROVEMENT :

1. Minor rework on the display in Time Tool.


### FIXES :

1. Enable lower clock speed cpu such as Dual Core Pentium/Celeron to run mars-sim.

2. Prevent mars-sim from attempting to run in any java VM version below 1.8.0.60.

1. Add a tab bar on top and segregate most Tools into their own tabs.

2. Add Earth and Mars Date/Time bar anchored near top center.

3. The 'Mars Navigator Tool' is renamed 'Navigator Minimap' and now has two maps stacked up on top of each other.

4. Both the Settlement Map and the Navigator Minimap are now displayed inside Map tab. They can be turned on at the click of their buttons on top right.

5. Add bullet bar and gauges for displaying a person's personalities (for both MBTI and Big Five Models)

6. Add the use of keyboard shortcuts (see /docs/help/shortcuts.html at Help Browser's User Guide under User Interface).


### CORE ENGINE IMPROVEMENTS:

1. Optimize numerous method calls for less cpu utilization.

2. Re-enable doing various scientific research tasks while inside a moving/non-moving vehicle (albeit with penalty).

3. Re-implement validation of all table cells in simulation configuration editor.

4. Mute/unmute the background music when the game is paused/resume.

5. Implement how choosing the settlement's objective would affect the VP (and production) of related goods.

6. Re-implement validation of settlements' name, population and # of bots entries in configuration editor.

7. Re-implement validation of latitude and longitude in the configuration editor.

8. Improve the Good Value Points (VS) updates for waste water, cooking consumables and others.

9. Add supplies of black water, grey water and regolith at the beginning of a new sim.

2. Remove duplicate calling of building update in each frame.

3. Fix tracking the whereabout of vehicles in the Location tab in the Vehicle Window.

4. Fix the electric lighting calculation for greenhouse operation.

5. Fix width and height determination of the quotation popup under different screen resolution. Add a scrollbar and text autowrapping.

6. Fix the latest URL not being displayed correctly in the address bar of Help Browswer.

7. Resolve a major linux UI issue. Can now switch between the Orange and Blue themes just like in Windows OS.

## v3.1.0 (build 3743) Snapshot Preview 3 - 2016-10-13

### NEW FEATURES :

1. Added user's option to change the height of the MarsNet chat box with the command '/y1', '/y2', '/y3', and '/y4' to suit the resolution of user's monitor.
/y1 --> 256 pixels (by default)
/y2 --> 512 pixels
/y3 --> 768 pixels
/y4 --> 1024 pixels

2. Added new user's keyword "settlement"/"vehicle"/"rover" in the chat box for reporting # of settlements in total and their names and to query the total # and types of vehicles/rovers (parked and/or on mission).

3. Added animated loading/saving/paused indicators.



### FIXES :

1. Fixed volume control with the ability to mute both the background music and sound effects.

2. Fixed NullPointerException/other bugs when loading a saved sim in either the Main Menu or the command prompt.

3. Enabled inline web browser to load quicker.

4. Fixed tracking the availability and usage of lighting for illuminating the food crop in greenhouses



### IMPROVEMENTS:

1. Refactored the meteorite impact calculation in MeteoriteImpactImpl.java and completed Part I and II below. (Part III still in-work).

Note: any observable impact will increase the stress level of the settlers on that building if his/her natural attribute of courage and emotional stability are not high enough.

Part I : Calculate the probability of impact per square meter per sol on the settlement, assuming the meteorite has an average impact velocity of 1km/s, critical diameter of .0016 cm and average density of 1 g/cm^3, per NASA study.

Part II: Calculate how far the incoming meteorite may penetrate the wall of a building

Part III: Implement equations of the probability distribution of different sizes of the meteorites. This no longer assumes the size and impact speed of the meteorites are homogeneous as in Part I and II.

## v3.1.0 (build 3729) Snapshot Preview 2 - 2016-09-27

### NEW FEATURES :

1. Added codes to abort an on-going vehicle mission without activating the emergency beacon. Vehicle will drive to the settlement if fuel and consumables are still available.

2. Optimizied the stress modifier on a few AI tasks.

3. Added more first and last names (of various national origin) in people.xml for settlers from various sponsoring space agencies.

4. Added new part "heat pipe" and used it throughout the sim.


### FIXES :

1. Temporarily disabled the ability for settlers to start a construction mission on his own (bug fixes still in-work).

2. Removed some case of a NullPointerException during a resupply mission and a building construction mission.

3. Fixed inability to save as default.sim and as other file names.

4. Fixed NullPointerException in Career Tab of a deceased person when opening the Person Window.

5. Fixed NullPointerException in Location Tab of a vehicle in some cases when opening the Vehicle Window.



### IMPROVEMENTS/OTHERS :

2. Limited the # of Sols activities to be saved to 100 Sols.

3. Improved linux compatibility in displaying UI.

4. Prevented settlers from having duplicated first and last names in a settlement. The chance of this happening in the real world is remotely possible. Therefore, we preclude it from happening in mars-sim.

5. Shrunk the size of the binaries by removing unused contents.

6. Revised files for the debian package, which can be installed via GDebi (Debian Package Installer) in linux.
