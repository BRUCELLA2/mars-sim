The Mars Simulation Project can be built in several ways.

** Ant build tool **

The preferred way to build the project is using the Ant build tool and 
the build.xml file in the scripts subdirectory.

Ant can be freely downloaded here: http://ant.apache.org

Ant can be used by going to the scripts subdirectory of the Mars Simulation 
Project and typing: ant <target> 

The following targets are available in the project's build.xml file:

compile: Compiles the source code but doesn't build the JAR files.

build: Compiles the source code and builds the JAR files.

clean-build: Deletes all the old class and JAR files and builds the project.

test: Performs a unit test on the project.  As of version 2.75, all unit tests
      are just stubbed out.
      
document: Creates JavaDoc documentation for the project in the docs directory.


** Windows batch files **

On a Windows system, the following batch files are also available:

make.bat: Compiles the source code and builds the JAR files.

test.bat: Performs unit tests on the project. As of version 2.75, all unit tests
          are just stubbed out.
          
document.bat: Creates JavaDoc documentation for the project in the docs directory.

MarsProject.bat: Starts the project with the saved simulation if it exists and is valid,
                 or starts a new simulation.
                 
        
** Linux/Unix shell scripts **

On a Linux/Unix system, the following shell scripts are available:

make.sh: Compiles the source code.

build_jars.sh: Builds the JAR files.

test.sh: Performs unit tests on the project. As of version 2.75, all unit tests
         are just stubbed out.
          
document.sh: Creates JavaDoc documentation for the project in the docs directory.

MarsProject.sh: Starts the project with the saved simulation if it exists and is valid,
                or starts a new simulation.
                
Makefile: Compiles the source code and builds the JAR files using the Unix make utility.
