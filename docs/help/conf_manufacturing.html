<P>The manufacturing.xml configuration file contains configuration for manufacturing processes that can be performed by 
settlers in manufacturing buildings.  Manufacturing processes can be added, edited, or deleted.</P>

<P>A "malfunction" element has the following attributes: "name", "tech", "skill", "work-time", and "process-time".  The 
"name" attribute has to be a unique name for the process.  The "tech" attribute is the minimum manufacturing building tech 
level required for the process.  The "skill" attribute is the minimum materials science skill required for a settler to
start or work on the process.  The "work-time" attribute is the total amount of effective work time (millisols) (See 
<A HREF="conf_time.html">"conf/time.txt"</A>) required to complete the process.  The "process-time" attribute is the total
amount of time (millisols) (See <A HREF="conf_time.html">"conf/time.txt"</A>) required for the process to be completed.</P>

<P>The "malfunction" element has the following child elements:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>inputs:</B> This is a list of input materials required for the process.  The inputs element is required, but there
can be zero to many child elements of the following types:</LI><BR>

<UL>
<LI><B>resource:</B> The resource element has a "name" attribute for a supported type of resource (See 
<A HREF="conf_resources.html">"conf/resources.txt"</A>).  The "amount" attribute is a decimal value of the amount of the 
resource (kilograms) needed.</LI><BR>

<LI><B>part:</B> The part element has a "name" attribute that must match up to a part listed in the conf/parts.xml file 
(See <A HREF="conf_parts.html">"conf/parts.xml"</A>).  The "number" attribute is the number of parts required.</LI><BR>
</UL>

<LI><B>outputs:</B> This is a list of output materials produced by the process.  The outputs element is required, but there
can be zero to many child elements of the following types:</LI><BR>

<UL>
<LI><B>resource:</B> The resource element has a "name" attribute for a supported type of resource (See 
<A HREF="conf_resources.html">"conf/resources.txt"</A>).  The "amount" attribute is a decimal value of the amount of the 
resource (kilograms) produced.</LI><BR>

<LI><B>part:</B> The part element has a "name" attribute that must match up to a part listed in the conf/parts.xml file 
(See <A HREF="conf_parts.html">"conf/parts.xml"</A>).  The "number" attribute is the number of parts produced.</LI><BR>

<LI><B>equipment:</B> The equipment element has a "name" attribute that must match up to a supported type of equipment
in the simulation (as of version 2.83, currently supported equipment are: "bag", "gas canister", "barrel", 
"specimen container", and "eva suit".  The "number" attribute is the number of equipment produced.</LI><BR>

<LI><B>vehicle:</B> The vehicle element has a "name" attribute that must match up to a vehicle type listed in the 
conf/vehicles.xml file (See <A HREF="conf_vehicles.html">"conf/vehicles.xml"</A>).  The "number" attribute is the number 
of vehicles produced.</LI><BR>
