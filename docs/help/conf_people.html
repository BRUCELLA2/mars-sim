<P>The people.xml configuration file contains configuration for physical limits of people as well as a list of possible names
for settlers.</P>

<P>The "oxygen-consumption-rate" element is the amount (kg) of oxygen an average person needs to consume each Sol 
(see <A HREF="conf_time.html">"conf/time.txt"</A>).</P>

<P>The "water-consumption-rate" element is the amount (kg) of water an average person needs to consume each Sol 
(see <A HREF="conf_time.html">"conf/time.txt"</A>).</P>

<P>The "food-consumption-rate" element is the amount (kg) of food an average person needs to consume each Sol 
(see <A HREF="conf_time.html">"conf/time.txt"</A>).</P>

<P>The "oxygen-deprivation-time" element is the time (millisols) (see <A HREF="conf_time.html">"conf/time.txt"</A>) an average person 
can survive without oxygen to breath.</P>

<P>The "water-deprivation-time" element is the time (sols) (see <A HREF="conf_time.html">"conf/time.txt"</A>) an average person can 
survive without water to drink.</P>

<P>The "food-deprivation-time" element is the time (sols) (see <A HREF="conf_time.html">"conf/time.txt"</A>) an average person can 
survive without food to eat.</P>

<P>The "starvation-start-time" element is the time (sols) (see <A HREF="conf_time.html">"conf/time.txt"</A>) an average person can 
go without food before starvation sets in.</P>

<P>The "min-air-pressure" element is the minimum air pressure (atm) that a person can withstand without harm.</P>

<P>The "decompression-time" element is the time (millisols) (see <A HREF="conf_time.html">"conf/time.txt"</A>) an average person 
can survive below the minimum air pressure (see above).</P>

<P>The "min-temperature" element is the minimum temperature (degrees Celsius) that a person can withstand without harm.</P>

<P>The "max-temperature" element is the maximum temperature (degrees Celsius) that a person can withstand without harm.</P>

<P>The "freezing-time" element is the time (millisols) (see <A HREF="conf_time.html">"conf/time.txt"</A>) that a person can survive 
temperatures below the minimum temperature (see above).</P>

<P>The "stress-breakdown-chance" element is the percent chance per millisol that a person will breakdown from maximum (100%) stress 
and have an anxiety attack. (See medical complaint: "Anxiety Attack" in <A HREF="medical.html">conf/medical.xml</A>)</P>

<P>The "gender-male-percentage" element is the percent chance a randomly generated person will be of the male gender.  Otherwise the person
will be of the female gender.</P>

<P>The "personality-types" element is a list of MBTI personality types and the percent chance that a randomly generated person will have a
particular ersonality type.  The percent chances of each personality type should collectively add up to 100%.  (See <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator" TARGET="_top">Wikipedia article on
MBTI</A> for more information.)</P>

<P>The "person-name-list" is a list of possible names for settlers in the simulation.  Each "person-name" element should have a unique "value"
attribute and a gender of either "male" or "female".  Additional names can be added here.</P>

<P>The "person-list" element is a list of configured people that will be in a simulation.  They will be created before any additional randomly
generated people will be created.  Each person has the following attributes: "name" - the person's name (required), "gender": the person's gender 
("male" or "female"), "personality-type" the person's MBTI personality type (see <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator" TARGET="_top">
Wikipedia article on MBTI</A> for more information), "settlement": The name of the settlement the person will start at (this must be a configured
settlement in <A HREF="conf_settlement.html">conf/settlement.xml</A>), and job ("Engineer", "Chef", "Driver", "Areologist", "Botanist" or "Doctor").</P>

<P>The "person-list" element has the following list elements inside it:</P>

<UL>

  <LI>"natural-attribute-list": A list of natural attributes the person has.  Must have the name of the attribute and a value from 0 (low) to 
      100 (high).  The following natural attributes are valid: "Strength", "Endurance", "Agility", "Teaching", "Academic Aptitude", "Experience
      Aptitude", "Stress Resilience", "Attractiveness", "Leadership" and "Conversation".</LI><BR>

  <LI>"skill-list": A list of skills the person starts with.  Must have the name of the skill and a value from 0 (low) and no upper limit.  The
      following skills are valid: "Driving", "Botany", "Mechanics", "EVA Operations", "Areology", "Medicine", "Cooking".</LI><BR>

  <LI>"relationship-list": A list of the person's relationships with other people.  Must have the name of another person configured in the person-list,
      and a opinion from 0 (low) to 100 (high).</LI><BR>
