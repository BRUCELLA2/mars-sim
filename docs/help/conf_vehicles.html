<BR>
<P>The vehicles.xml configuration file contains configuration for the vehicles in the simulation.  Currently only rover vehicles are
  supported, but hope to have other types of vehicles soon.</P>
<P>The "rover" element defines a type of rover.  Each rover must have a unique "type" attribute that is used to refer to it in other
  configuration files.  Rovers have the following child elements:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><B>fuel-efficiency:</B> This is the fuel efficiency (km/kg) of the rover.  Rovers currently use methane as fuel.  This is a required
    element.</LI>
  <LI><B>base-speed:</B> This is the normal top speed (km/hr) of the rover.  This is a required element.</LI>
  <LI><B>empty-mass:</B> This is the mass (kg) of the rover when it is unloaded.  This is a required element.</LI>
  <LI><B>crew-size:</B> This is the maximum number of people the rover can hold.  This is a required element.</LI>
  <LI><B>cargo:</B> This is the cargo capacity list for the rover.  The "total-capacity" element is the total mass (kg) of cargo the rover
    can hold.  Each "capacity" element has a "resource" attribute that must be a valid resource (see <A HREF="conf_resources.html">"conf/resources.txt"</A>).  The "value" attribute is the mass (kg) of that resource the rover can 
    hold.</LI>
  <LI><B>sickbay:</B> This is the rover's sickbay.  The "tech-level" attribute is the treatment technology level of the sickbay (see <A HREF="conf_tech_level.html">"conf/tech_level.txt"</A>).  The "beds" attribute is the number of beds in the sickbay.  This is an 
    optional element and its absence means that the rover doesn't have a sickbay.</LI>
  <LI><B>lab:</B> This is the rover's laboratory.  The "tech-level" attribute is the technology level of the laboratory (see <A HREF="conf_tech_level.html">"conf/tech_level.txt"</A>).  There is a child element for each technology speciality of the lab.  
    The "tech-speciality" elements must have a 
    value of one of the currently supported research areas: "Areology", "Botany" or "Medicine".  This element is optional and its absence
    indicates that the rover doesn't have a laboratory.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The "rover-name-list" element is a list of rover names that is randomly selected from when rovers are created for the simulation.</P>
<P>Each "rover-name" element must have a unique "value" attribute.</P>
